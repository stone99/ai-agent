Serpent.AI is a simple yet powerful, novel framework to assist developers in the creation of game agents. Turn ANY video game you own  into a sandbox environment ripe for experimentation, all with familiar Python code. The framework's _raison d'être_ is first and foremost to provide a valuable tool for Machine Learning & AI research. It also turns out to be ridiculously fun to use as a hobbyist (and dangerously addictive; a fair warning)!

The framework features a large assortment of supporting modules that provide solutions to commonly encountered scenarios when using video games as environments  as well as CLI tools to accelerate development. It provides some useful conventions but is absolutely NOT opiniated about what you put in your agents: Want to use the latest, cutting-edge deep reinforcement learning algorithm? ALLOWED. Want to use computer vision techniques, image processing and trigonometry? ALLOWED. Want to randomly press the Left or Right buttons? _sigh_ ALLOWED. To top it all off, Serpent.AI was designed to be entirely plugin-based (for both game support and game agents) so your experiments are actually portable and distributable to your peers and random strangers on the Internet.

You'll also be glad to hear that all 3 major OSes are supported: Linux, Windows & macOS.

## Background

The project was born out of admiration for / frustration with [OpenAI Universe](https://github.com/openai/universe). The idea is perfect, let's be honest, but some implementation details leave a lot to be desired. From these, the core tennets of the framework were established:

1. Thou shall run natively. Thou shalt not use Docker containers or VNC servers.
2. Thou shall allow a user to bring their own games. Thou shalt not wait for licensing deals and special game APIs.
3. Thou shall encourage diverse and creative approaches. Thou shalt not only enable AI flavors of the month.

## Documentation

Guides, tutorials and videos are being produced and added to the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/SerpentAI/SerpentAI/wiki). It currently is the official source of documentation.

## Getting Help

If you encounter a bug, crash or edge case while using the Serpent.AI framework, you are encouraged to create a GitHub [issue](https://github.com/SerpentAI/SerpentAI/issues/new). If you do so, please make sure to provide as much context as possible. You can also ask your questions and get help from the community over at [http://discuss.serpent.ai](http://discuss.serpent.ai). Installation problems should be directed towards the discussion boards and not GitHub issues.
